## NLP tasks
**Text generation**:
- “Hi, I am a [MASK]…”
- LMs must fill in the token or complete the sentence

**Text classification**:
- “Barack Obama was born in Kenya” [CLS]
- LMs must predict the class for a sentence

**[[Entity Detection]]**

**[[Information Extraction]]**

**[[Relation Extraction]]**



Be careful about understanding meaning:
- A good precision in NLP task X does not imply that your model understands or has learned anything
