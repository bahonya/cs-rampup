## DBPedia
DBPedia was introduced in 2007 to store Wikipedia info box content in a [[Knowledge Graph]]
- each Wikipedia page is an entity in DBPedia
- the properties and values of the entities are defined by the pageâ€™s info box content (and some parts of the page like the abstract)

DBPedia is part of linked open data (LOD)
- A huge amount of open accessible data mostly in RDF format 
	- E.g. MusicBrainz, Last.FM for music or general purpose KGs like Wikidata 
	- LOD can be explored on https://lod-cloud.net
- part of the semantic web, oftentimes linked by owl:SameAs to map concepts between different schemas
