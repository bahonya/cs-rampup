## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is the field of processing natural language texts by machines

### History of NLP
- Symbolic NLP (1950-1990) - Hand-written set of rules are applied to process texts
- Statistical NLP (1990-2010) - A mixture of hand-written rules and machine learning
- Neural NLP (present) - Neural deep learning architectures generalize rules automatically from large-scale training data


- [[Syntactical analysis]] parses the syntax of texts by
	- Chunking texts into sentences and parsing their grammatic
- [[Semantical analysis]] derives the textâ€™s meaning by
	- Determining the meaning of words and sentences
