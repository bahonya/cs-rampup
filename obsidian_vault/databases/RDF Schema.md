## RDF Schema
[[RDF]] itself allows the use of any [[URI]] reference 
- However, often it is beneficial to restrict the possible terms and/or relations (i.e., the vocabulary) to increase interoperability between [[RDF]] documents 
- RDF schemas (RDF-S) provides basic elements for the description of vocabulary [[Ontologies]]
	- i.e., classes, subclasses, literals, datatypes, â€¦ 
	- note: unlike in OOP classes, properties of RDF-S classes are defined on their own and assigned to the classes via range or domain
