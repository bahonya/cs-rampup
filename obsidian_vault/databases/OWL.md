## OWL
The web [[Ontologies]] language (OWL) can be used to define [[Ontologies]]
- Again a W3C standard in three flavors: 
	- OWL Lite: Concepts and roles for building classification hierarchies
	- OWL DL: based on description logics with more expressiveness than OWL Lite while still being decidable
	- OWL Full: preserves compatibility with RDF-S but is not decidable
- Tools like Protégé can be used to work with ontologies
