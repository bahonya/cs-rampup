In the lecture we discussed the **first three normal forms**

### First Normalform
- data is dependent on the key
- no duplicates

### Second Normalform
- data is dependent on the *whole* key
- there is no subset of key attributes that would also be sufficient to identify the entries

### Third Normalform
- data is dependent only on the key
- there is no set of non-attributes that can be used to identify another non-key attribute
- no dependencies between non-key attributes
