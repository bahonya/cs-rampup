## Ontologies
- [[RDF Schema]] is used to build a vocabulary ontology
- In computer science ontologies are formal, explicit specifications of a shared conceptualization
	- Basically ontologies provide a shared vocabulary, e.g. the type of objects/concepts that exist along with their properties and relations
	- Domain ontologies model the real world with respect to a specific domain
		- this also disambiguates most terms but domain ontologies are not compatible with each other
		- e.g. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
