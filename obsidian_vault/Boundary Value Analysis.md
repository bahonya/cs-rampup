## Boundary Value Analysis
**Boundary Values**:
- Boundaries of the specification
- Values, for which the constraint of the specification just holds (or just does not hold)

**Special Values**:
- Value 0 
- Empty fields, sequences and character strings
- Single-element fields, sequences and character strings
- Null-References
- Special characters (control character, tabulator)
- Edges of Number Intervals 
- thresholds
