## Integration Test
**Precondition**
- [[Unit Test|Unit tests]] have been successfully completed.
**Integration**:
- Groups of components are integrated into subsystems
- Run by developers, testers or integration teams.
**Integration Test**:
- Test if the communication between components is working.
**Aim**
- Find errors in interfaces and interactions between components.

**Problem**:
In which order are the components integrated?
When is it as effective and efficient as possible?
Components are finished at different times
Testers should not be idle just because a component is not ready yet

This results in different [[Integration strategies]]â€¦
