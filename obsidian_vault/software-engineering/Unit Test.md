## Unit Test
Each component is tested individually, in isolation. Implemented software units are systematically tested.

Faults can be clearly traced back to the source.  Components can be interconnected, but this is not considered in the unit [[Testing|test]] - only the component itself is tested. Unit tests are based on the component specification, the code and all related documents.
