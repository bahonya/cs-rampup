## Error Chain
All fault conditions and defects occur during the completion.
- The **failure** (error effect) occurs during program execution.
- The failure is generated by a **fault** (error state) in the software.
- The fault is triggered by an **error** (error action) of a human (programmer). Fault masking: “An occurrence in which one defect prevents the detection of another”

To recognize a fault, the normal situation must be defined.
