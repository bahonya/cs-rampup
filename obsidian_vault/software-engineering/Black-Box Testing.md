## Black-Box Testing
**Fundamental Idea**: Specification-based test approach

**Particularities**:
- No information about inner structure or source code
- Execution is controlled via input values
- The behavior of the test object is monitored externally
- Models and requirements are used to derive test cases

There are 2 types of Black-Box Testing:
- [[Equivalence classes testing]]
- [[Boundary Value Analysis]]
